        <h1 class="group1">Physical abuse:</h1>
        <p class="group1">Physical abuse is when a person intentionally hurts another person. This can be particularly problematic because physical abuse can result in people's death. physical abuse like most other types of violence sticks with a person all their life so when they are away from their abusers they still need help. This can make it so that when they interact with other people they may be physically abusive since they think of it as normal.</p>

        <h1 class="group1">Imformation of causes of violence:</h1>
        <p class="group1">There are many causes of violence such as Racism and Homophobia. these ideas are particularly dangerous because they apply to a lot of people and are believed by more so everyone gets hurt. </h1>
            <br>

        <h1 class="group1">When it started:</h1>
        <p class="group1">Violence has been a part of nature ever since animals have existed. However, the first documented case violence between humans began around 13,000 BC. It's obvious that there has been violence between humans before that point but it does prove that violence has always been a thing.</p>

        <br>

        <h1 class="group1">Name-Calling:</h1>
        <p class="group1">Name-calling followed up by other forms of non-physical violence can cause people to lose control of themselves and become physically violent. Most violent crimes aren't just because someone decided to be violent all of a sudden it is usually because a group or a person triggered their anger.</p>

        <br>

        <h1 class="group1">Emotional:</h1>
        <p class="group1">Someone's emotional state can impact their violent tendancies. If someone's particularly upset they might do something drastic and be violent with people. This can make other people emotionally hurt creating a cycle of violence which is difficult to stop.</p>

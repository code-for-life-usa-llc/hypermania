However, not all of the effects are physical. Violence can lead to depression and the suicidal thoughts which can lead to further violence.

However, violence can also occur in one's mind due to mental abuse. This particularly problematic because the effects of mental abuse will remain even after the physical problem is over inside of one's mind.

          <p class="text">Racism is one of the many causes of violence which causes people to be physically and mentally hurt. Racism as a concept is based off of a suedo science from centuries ago. There is no reason for people to still believe in racism yet they still do. Now millions upon millions of people have died dues to racism yet some people still haven't realized what is wrong with racism and continue to practise it. Most people associate racism with white people surpressing black people. However, everyone that has been classified as a certain race has been hurt by racism.</p>

          <p class="text">Sexual abuse is one of the most prominent types of violence. This is mostly done to women especially those of minorities but it would be wrong to assume that men cannot be sexually abused. Although this is illegal the government and other private institutions like colleges aren't doing anything about it making this problem even worse.</p>
